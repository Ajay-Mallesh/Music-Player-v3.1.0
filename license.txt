Below is a replacement license text that removes the MIT permissions and makes the work copyright-protected, with use allowed only under fair use or with explicit permission approval.

This is not an MIT License anymore; it is a restrictive copyright license.

Important notes
This license is closed-source and not OSI-approved

“Fair use” is determined by law, not by the license itself

If you plan to publish this publicly (GitHub, npm, etc.), this clearly prevents reuse without permission

If you want, I can:

Make this shorter and stricter

Add a commercial licensing clause

Add contact instructions for permission requests

Convert it into a custom named license (e.g., “AjayMallesh Restricted License”)
